 Based on the discussion at http://octave.1599824.n4.nabble.com/Can-we-freely-use-AMOS-in-Octave-td4642557.html, AMOS is included in openspecfun as public domain software
 The AMOS functions are included in SLATEC, and the SLATEC guide 
 (http://www.netlib.org/slatec/guide) explicitly states: 

         "The Library is in the public domain and distributed by the Energy 
 Science and Technology Software Center." 

 Mention of AMOS's inclusion in SLATEC goes back at least to this 1985 
 technical report from Sandia National Labs:
